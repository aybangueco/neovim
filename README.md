# My personal neovim configuration

This repository contains my neovim configuration setup. I started with kickstart,
and modifies it along the way. Piece by piece, replicating my productivity needs from vscode.
My laptop is getting older (15+ years), I have to move away from vscode, luckily neovim is so easy to use.
